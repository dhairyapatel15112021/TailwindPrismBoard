# TailwindPrismBoard
Tailwind Prism Board is a responsive web application built using React and Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a practical exercise to explore and apply the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, in a React environment. As the first project created using Tailwind CSS, it demonstrates the integration and styling capabilities of Tailwind CSS to build a visually appealing and functional dashboard interface.
